# LBRY-Women-Education-
The problem of women’s education in India is one which attracts our attention immediately. In our country, due to conservative traditionalism, women’s status has been considered to be lower than that of men since ages. During the later part of the Vedic period, the Aryans had sealed the fate of women culturally and socially by denying them the right to study Vedas and thus half of the population was deprived of one of the most fundamental human rights.  Even today, in spite of the recognition of women’s status equal to that of men, the majority of them suffer in primitive ignorance as ever before.
